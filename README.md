# Nonparametric-Statistics
A nonparametric method is a mathematical inference method that does not consider the underlying assumptions on the shape of the probability distribution of the population. 

## Project 1
Aggression data regarding aggressive behavior in relation to exposure to violent television programs, available in the PASWR2 package in R, is used. 
I have compared several statistical tests to test whether the median difference is > 0 at alpha = 0.05.
Tests performed are the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, the One-Sample Sign test, and the One-Sample t-test.  

## Project 2
Fertilize data available in the PASWR2 package in R is used. Plants' heights in inches obtained from two seeds, one obtained by cross-fertilization and the other by auto-fertilization, are recorded in two opposite but separate locations of a pot.
I have compared several statistical tests to test whether the mean = 0 at alpha = 0.05.
Tests performed are the One-Sample t-test, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, and the Permutation test.

### Only the PASWR2 package in R is used in both projects.
